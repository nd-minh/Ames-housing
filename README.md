# What are the factors that influence house prices in Ames, Iowa?

In this project, we will pretend that we are working in the city council of Ames, Iowa and we are planing to build multiple new constructions, for example, new roads, new parks, new hospitals, in the city in the next 5 years. For this purpose, we want to understand what the factors behind the house prices are so that we can create a fair reimbursement plan for the families that will need to relocate to give place for the new constructions. To this end, we look at a dataset about the house prices in Ames and will use it to understand as well as to predict house prices. To be specific, we would like to answer the following questions.

1. Can we predict the house prices in Ames?
2. If yes, how well can we predict the house price?
3. Other than prediction, what are the factors that most influence house prices in Ames?
